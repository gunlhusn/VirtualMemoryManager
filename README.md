# Virtual Memory Manager

<h3> This repository implements a simulated virtual memory manager 
    and by accomplishing the following:</h3>

- Implement TLB and Page Table structures
- Read and write to file (txt/bin)
- Using the above, map virtual addresses to physical ones
- Update the TLB and Page tables using FIFO and LRU logic
- Handles the case where physical memory is less than the virtual memory: clock algorithm (second chance algorithm) 
- Calculate and output the translated address count, page fault rate, and TLB hit rate
